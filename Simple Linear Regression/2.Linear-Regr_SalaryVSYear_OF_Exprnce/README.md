Simple Linear implementation with python

Ill advice you gather some knowledge on Statistics and linewar algebra(Not much though)
This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way"


## Overview of the code and everything

I'm using a small dataset on salary to prove this relationship.

Here are some helpful links:


#### Sum of squared distances formula (to calculate our error)

#### Partial derivative with respect to b and m (to perform gradient descent)
Some calculus

## Dependencies

* numpy for numerical compuation esp in the partial derivatives
* matplotlib for graphical visualization

Python 3 is a preferable one for this


## Usage

Just run ``python3 salary_linear_regression.py``
